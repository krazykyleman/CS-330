How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software by first understanding what I am to do. This helped me understand code, previously written code, and how to implement it in my own way. This was really helpful for learning C++ and OpenGL in general. I think I can use this for future projects that I have a smaller understanding of the language or API I am using. I am a better researcher basically.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The same way I approach designing software. The only difference is that there are usually going to be customers that use the programs rather than software. What I mean by this is I try to make the full program a lot more user friendly than just the software's code.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

My goal is to be a computer scientist for a tech company and help change the world. That's a big goal and obviously I need to learn to code to do so.
Educational OR professional this class was useful in developing my skills in being able to code, use logic while coding, and to be able to teach myself how to make programs with little to no information on what it is I am using. For ex: OpenGL's api was hard to learn. But once I read resources and asked questions I started to really get it!
